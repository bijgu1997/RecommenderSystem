# An Book Recommender System based on a CLIPS Expert System

This repository contains a dataset (taken from: https://github.com/luminati-io/Amazon-popular-books-dataset) and a Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of a recommendation system based on a CLIPS expert system. The notebook and its contents are part of my assignment submission for Module 9 of the Masters in Artificial Intelligence at IDEA Academy.
